    <h2>What Do You Know About Tokyo?</h2>
    <p>Tokyo is Japan's capital and the world's most populous metropolis. Its one of Japan's 47 prefectures and consists of 23 central city wards and multiple cities and towns. Prior to 1868, Tokyo was known as Edo. A small castle town in the 16th century, Edo became Japan's political center in 1603. A few decades later, Edo had grown into one of the world's most populous cities. With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the capital moved from Kyoto to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo. Large parts of Tokyo were destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 and in the air raids of 1945. Today, Tokyo offers a seemingly unimited choice of shopping, entertainment, culture and dining to its visitors. The city's history can be appreciated in district's such as Asakusa and in a number of museums.</p>
